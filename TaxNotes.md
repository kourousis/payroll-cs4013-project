# Example Tax Breakdown
### All taxes are calculated with the assumption that the earner is single without children or any other dependants. 
## Senior Administrator(1)- €39, 893 per Annum
### PRSI
#### Weekly Gross: €39, 893 / 52 = €767.17

You have gross weekly earnings of €767.17 (before tax).

1.Calculate one-sixth of your earnings over €352.01:

```
€767.17 - €352.01 = €415.16
€415.16 divided by 6 = €69.19
````

2.Subtract this from the maximum credit of €12 to get your PRSI credit(Only available when earning less than €424 per week):

```
Earning over €424 per Week, no PRSI credit available. 
```

3.From 1 October 2024, calculate the basic PRSI charge at 4.1% of your earnings:

```
€767.17 x 4.1% = €31.45.
```

4.Deduct the PRSI credit from the PRSI charge to get the amount of PRSI you pay:

```
No PRSI credit available:
€31.45 - €0 = €31.45

You will pay PRSI of €31.45 weekly.
€31.45 Weekly * 52 = €1635.24
```

### Income Tax

Income tax in Ireland is calculated using two primary rates, a standard rate (20%) and a higher rate (40%). The cut-off point for these rates varies based on personal circumstances. In this example, we assume the standard cut-off for a single person in 2024 is €42,000 annually.

1. **Income Tax Rate Bands**:
   - 20% on income up to €42,000 annually.
   - 40% on income above €42,000 annually.

2. **Income Tax Calculation**:
   - Since €39,893 is below the annual cut-off for the higher rate, all income is taxed at 20%.

€39,893 x 20% = €7,978.60
You will pay Income Tax of **€7,978.60 annually**.
